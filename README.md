# Collect images

#### A Figma Plugin to find all images on a file and extract the originals to a zip file.

This plugin goes through the whole file finding images, and collects them on a zip file for download.

This is useful when you used many images and don't have easy access to the original images (ie. moodboard, website mockup), and want to extract the original files.

## How to use

This version has no options and has no UI. Just run the plugin and you will be prompted to download a zip file. Large files may take a while.

## Development

After cloning the repo, run `npm install`.

Then, to compile run `npm run dev`
